# Graph search project

The project involves searching through the nodes of a graph with different algorithms to find a solution. In this case, it is the imdb.com database, and the project aims to connect 2 actors through films or other actors.

In order to find solution, 2 algorithms are implemented:
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search


For example\
input: \
Robert Downey Jr., Tom Cruise\
output:\
Robert Downey Jr. and Kenneth Branagh played in The Gingerbread Man\
Kenneth Branagh and Tom Cruise played in Valkyrie
